# Spring Code Challenges
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Spring Code Challenges. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

Spring is one of the most popular Java frameworks, and if you’re a developer, that means that you not only have to understand Spring, you also have to constantly update your skills and continue learning about Spring. In this course, Cecili Reid presents 10 different Spring-related challenges through a Java application. She tests your knowledge of Spring features like setting up an actuator, scheduling jobs, providing images for client request, bulk importing with Spring Batch, and more. You can complete the challenges in any order, then compare your solutions to Cecili’s. Whether you’re looking to test your existing knowledge or learn something new, this course can give you a good idea of the current state of your Spring skills.
